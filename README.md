# _Day 1_

My first day at GNDEC i.e. July 31,2025,was a remarkable day for me.The day started with Gurbani.From 8.30am to 9.30am we heard Japji Sahib,Gurbani Kirtan,Anand Sahib,Ardas and Hukamnama Sahib with full respect.The atmosphere was calm and when all the students started reciting kirtan with the ragis it made it more peaceful.Then we went to take tea and snacks.

Then all the CSE and IT students started assembling in the auditorium.It was about 10.30 am.I was overwhelmed when the Induction program in the auditorium started.The stage was beautifully decorated.The 70th foundation day of the institution was being celebrated.

First of all *Mr. Harsimran Singh* welcomed the students and told us all about the infrastructure of the institution.After that *Madam Harpreet Kaur Grewal* (HOD of Applied Sciences) talked to the students.She talked about prayer,patience, perseverance etc.She taught us the ways to grow our personality being in the institution.Following that our respected principal *Sir Sehijpal Singh Ji* motivated us to make the best use of the platform.

*Mr Ravinder Garg* was invited as the chief guest to mark the occasion,who also interacted with us.Then *Mr Kulwinder Singh* (HOD of IT department) talked to the audience and he said that CS and IT are almost same.He also said that we should focus on our goals and stop regretting about the past.

Our last speaker of the day was *Mr.Ashok Singla* ,a finance person.He talked about Education Loan and Financial Literacy.The interesting thing about him was that he came to the college for the first time since 1991.He also studied in this great institution and now he is a successful person. The same I expect from myself.
After that NCC cadets gave some introduction about NCC to the students.

After that our Department Orientation program started our professors came an introduced themselves and gave us the important information.At the end of the day we visited our Labs.My day in the college ended with great and much big dreams in my eyes.

He made difficult concepts of science and mathematics very easy to understand by some very interesting experiments which seemed like a magic to the viewers.He not just only gave us academic knowledge in an extraordinary way but also gave us spiritual knowledge about Gurbani,Guru Nanak Dev Ji,Ik Onkar and God.This was one of my favourite sessions till then.

The day just not ended there was another amazing expert lecture by *Dr. Priya Darshani Madam* on Universal Human Values(UHV),a subject that delves into the essence of what it means to live a fulfilling and contented life. It was an interactive session.We explored the concept of happiness and the state of contentment, discussing how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions.
